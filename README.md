# Matplotlib Data Visualization App

## Description

This project is a Matplotlib-based data visualization tool that generates random data for two columns: years (x-axis) and inflation (y-axis). It allows you to continuously display and analyze this data in a graphical format. Matplotlib, a powerful data visualization library, is used to create informative and visually appealing plots.

## Features

1. **Random Data Generation:** The application generates random data for years and inflation values, starting from the year 1900. When the year reaches 2022, the data generation starts again from 1900, creating a cyclic data pattern.

2. **Continuous Display:** The Matplotlib app reads the data source file specified on the command line and continuously displays the data points. It shows 30 data points at a time, creating a rolling view of the data.

3. **Statistics Display:** The plot includes axis labels that dynamically display the maximum and minimum values of the data within the visible range. This allows users to quickly grasp the range of data being displayed.

4. **Title:** The plot is accompanied by an appropriate title to describe the data being visualized.
